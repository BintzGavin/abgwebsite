    <p class="lede">Gladney has provided Independent Adoption services for several years, and offers a high level of service to adoptive parents and birth parents. Each adoption, like each family, is unique. Our goal is to get to know you and understand your situation so that, together, we can customize your adoption experience to meet your needs.</p>
    <p>The Independent Adoption program allows adoptive parents who have already located their own birthmother to utilize the outstanding adoption services Gladney provides for both the birth mother and the adoptive parents. Gladney and an adoption attorney (or out-of-Texas adoption agency) will then facilitate the adoption.</p>
    <p>Gladney is also able to work with licensed adoption agencies to provide counsel and support to birth mothers in Texas working with an adoptive couple outside of the State of Texas. </p>
